Your team at JPMorgan Chase is soon launching a new credit card. You are asked to estimate how many cards you'll issue in the first month.

Before you can answer this question, you want to first get some perspective on how well new credit card launches typically do in their first month.

Write a query that outputs the name of the credit card, and how many cards were issued in its launch month. The launch month is the earliest record in the monthly_cards_issued table for a given card. Order the results starting from the biggest issued amount.


Solution:

Using cte, create a table card_launch in which i will have issue_date using make_date function(year,month,1)  and will get minimum_issue_date column of it using min() function.
Then, I will use partition by with card_name.
Now our CTE is ready
with this CTE i will query the required credentials that is card_name, issue_amount giving the condition as issue_date = launch_date order by issue_amount

with card_launch as
(select card_name, issue_amount, Make_date(issue_year,issue_month,1) as issue_date, min(Make_date(issue_year,issue_month,1)) as min_issue_date over (partition by card_name)
from monthly_card_issued) 
select card_name, issue_amount where issue_date = min_issue_date order by issue_amount desc;
