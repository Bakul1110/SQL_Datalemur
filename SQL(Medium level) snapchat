Assume you are given the tables below containing information on Snapchat users, their ages, and their time spent sending and opening snaps.
Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps (as a percentage of total time spent on these activities) for each age group.


select age.age_bucket, ROUND(100.0* sum(activities.time_spent) filter(where activities.activity_type = 'send')/sum(activities.time_spent),2)
as send_perc,
ROUND(100.0* sum(activities.time_spent) filter(where activities.activity_type = 'open')/sum(activities.time_spent),2)
as open_perc from activities inner join age_breakdown as age on activities.user_id = age.user_id
where activities.activity_type in('send','open')
GROUP BY age.age_bucket;
